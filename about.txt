The program is a console password manager.
The principle of operation is that the program creates an xmls table,
where the sheet name is the account name, and the cells are the login, password and additional information,
then encrypts it with the encryption key you specify.
Then when you need a password for any account,
you run the program, open the password database with
your encryption key, and find out the password for the required account.

The python libraries are used (simple-crypt, stdiomask, openpyxl)

So far, one of the shortcomings in the operation of the program is when working with the password database
You have to overwrite and delete files several times.

The program is written for Linux and Android

STRONGLY NOT RECOMMENDED FOR WINDOWS
for security reasons!
